        <div class="container">
          <div class="collapse">
            This website exercised organizing site architecture when using example templates
            provided by Bootstrap, to play with working code.<br>
            It features a navbar that collapses in mobile sizing, a jumbotron, a carousel
            that cycles photos with a manual option to move photos back and forth as well.<br><br>
            The use of Bootstrap's grid systems of rows and 12 columns will be the most
            translatable to other work, for me!
