      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/thejensen/Vacation">Vacationing in Sweden</a></li>
        <p>Technology: Bootstrap, HTML, CSS<br>
          This website exercised organizing site architecture when using
          example templates provided by Bootstrap, to play with working
          code. <br>
          It features a navbar that collapses in mobile sizing, a
          jumbotron, a carousel that cycles photos with a manual option
          to move photos back and forth as well. <br>
          The use of Bootstrap's grid systems of rows and 12 columns will
          be the most translatable to other work, for me!</p>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/thejensen/band">The Beatles Fan Site</a></li>
        <p>Technology: HTML, CSS<br>
          You'll find a template for a band fan website, which included
          html and css only.<br>
          On this site, there is the first sidebar I've ever made!</p>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/thejensen/resume">Resume: Sara Jensen</a></li>
        <p>Technology: HTML, CSS<br>

        <li><a href="https://github.com/thejensen/blog">Blog</a></li>
        <p>Technology: HTML, CSS<br>

        <li><a href="https://github.com/thejensen/boring-lecture">Civil Engineering Lecture</a></li>
        <p>Technology: HTML, CSS<br>

        <li><a href="https://github.com/thejensen/decorator">Interior Decorator</a></li>
        <p>Technology: HTML, CSS<br>

        <li><a href="https://github.com/thejensen/cupcake">Cupcake Shop</a></li>
        <p>Technology: HTML, CSS<br>

        <li><a href="https://github.com/thejensen/resort">Private Island Resort</a></li>
        <p>Technology: HTML, CSS<br>
          A client requested a site to share information about their Private Island Resort.
          They wanted several pages that describe accommodations, travel, etc., with navigation
          back to the homepage.<br>
          This project helped us understand git branching. With two branches, we offered
          our client the same website styled in two different ways. We also published
          the final version of the client's choosing to github.io.


        <li><a href="https://github.com/thejensen/cookie-recipe">Cookie Recipe</a></li>
        <p>Technology: HTML, CSS<br>


        <li><a href="https://github.com/thejensen/my-first-webpage">My First Webpage</a></li>
        <p>Technology: HTML, CSS, Markdown<br>
          This project introduced us to block and in-line elements, images, and more. We were also
          first introduced to styling with CSS here, like changing the background color and font
          of text by indicating which elements we wanted to change. First README.md added to this
          page. Sub-projects included:
            <ol>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/thejensen/my-first-webpage/blob/master/rabbit-page.html">Rabbit Profiles</a></li>
              <p>Technology: HTML, CSS<br>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/thejensen/my-first-webpage/blob/master/favorite-places.html">My Favorite Places</a></li>

        <li><a href="https://github.com/thejensen/goodbye">Goodbye World</a></li>
        <p>Technology: HTML<br>
          This is a spin off the basic hello-world project, where we continued practice
          on adding, committing, and pushing to github.
        <li><a href="https://github.com/thejensen/hello-world">Hello World</a></li>
        <p>Technology: HTML<br>
          This is a basic hello-world introduction to writing a website in html. We also
          learned to push any basic change to a github repository.
