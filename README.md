## Description

_Welcome to my portfolio of web development work. I am happy to share with you all
the things I have been working on! To get in touch with me, please see contact info below._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Simply open this in your favorite web browser by going to http://thejensen.github.io/portfolio._

_This code depends on Bootstrap and browsers to run as expected as of August 2016._

## Known Bugs

_The "Details" buttons in the project descriptions open all the project descriptions
at once. I am excited to get them working independently of each other. If they impact
the UI too much in the future, even when they do work properly, I may remove them
all together._

## Support and contact details

_If they run into any issues or have questions, ideas or concerns, or are interested
in contributing to this code, please reach out to me at jensen.sara.e@gmail.com}_

## Technologies Used

_This portfolio was developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap CSS, Bootstrap Javascript and jquery._
